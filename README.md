# Yuuna's Website
This is the documentation and configuration website for my [Yuuna bot](https://www.github.com/Esdia/Yuuna).

This website offer a more complete documentation than the help command of the bot, it's purpose is mainly that many people prefer reading on a website, while scrolling and clicking, than in the small boxes of the discord messages.
You can also configure every feature from the [dashboard](https://yuuna-website.herokuapps.com/dashboard).

The page [commands](https://yuuna-website.herokuapps.com) displays a full list of all the commands, along with the needed permission to use it if there is one.

This website runs on [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and is hosted on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
